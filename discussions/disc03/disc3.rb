# We will be implimenting a simple database using Ruby data structures to store the data.
# A database can contain an arbitrary number of tables. Each table will contain tuples of size n, where n is the number of columns in
# the table.
# Through a series of discussion exercises each week, we will improve upon our simple database.
# This week we will create a Database representation that will implement some basic functionality.
# The class Tuple represents and entry in a table.
# The class Table represents a collection of tuples.
# The class Database represents the entire system of Tables against which a user can run queries.
